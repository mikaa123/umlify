Features to add
===============
* Support modules (yUML doesn't seem to support Packages yet)
  - Create a png file for each module?

* Make classes in the html file clickable, so that it links to
  the corresponding RDoc file

* Add annotation - need to define how, and what -

* How about an export to XMI? I think that sounds good.

* Add a way to show dependencies between two classes

Maintainance
============
* Refactor ParserSexp class. It's ugly.

Issues
======
* Make it support Ruby 1.9

Grocery
=======
* Sriracha sauce :9
